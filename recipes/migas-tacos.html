    <h1>Migas Tacos</h1>
    <img src="../images/Migas-Tacos.jpg" alt="migas tacos on a plate">
    <p>Migas is a dish traditionally made from stale bread and other ingredients in 
        Spanish and Portuguese cuisines. Originally introduced by shepherds, migas are 
        very popular across the Iberian Peninsula, and are the typical breakfast of 
        hunters at monter√≠as in southern Spain.
    </p>
    <p>This tex-mex variation of migas uses tortilla chips in place of stale bread and 
        is best served up as a taco.
